        The fundamentals of the Pomodoro Technique are simple yet incredibly effective
      </h1>
      <p>The process underlying the Pomodoro Technique consists of 6 steps:</p>
      <div>
        <h2>1. <span>Choose a task</span> you'd like to get done</h2>
        <p>
          Something big, something small, something you’ve been putting off 
          for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s 
          something that deserves your full, undivided attention.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>2. <span>Set the Pomodoro</span> for 25 minutes</h2>
        <p>
          Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and I 
          will not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>3. <span>Work on the task</span> until the Pomodoro rings</h2>
        <p>
            Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes. If you suddenly realize 
            you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>4. When the Pomodoro rings, <span>put a checkmark</span> on a paper</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro on a task.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>5. <span>Take a short break</span> on a paper</h2>
        <p>
          Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else 
          relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>6. Every 4 pomodoros, <span>take a longer break</span> on a paper</h2>
        <p>
            Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. 20 minutes 
            is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest 
            before the next round of Pomodoros.
