# ![Tomato](https://github.com/Sl4rtyb4rtf4st/pomodorotimer/blob/master/favicon-32x32.png?raw=true) Pomodoro Timer
A timer app for the [pomodoro](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) time management technique, with notifications on completion of the timer.
The page includes a relatively short explanation on the Pomodoro technique copied from the official documentation 

[Link](https://sl4rtyb4rtf4st.github.io/pomodorotimer/) to the github page version of the timer

## Gulp
Changing the repo to a Gulp project, serving the page using github pages should then use the dist folder as the site has been moved to there. Still have to figure out how to do that. This [link](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490) should give a good explanation on how to do that, but I haven't gotten round to it yet.

To use the Gulp version run:
```sh
npm install
gulp
```
You can run `gulp watch` when you wish to code the repo and have live reload functionality
